# Delphi Live Templates
Live Templates for Delphi custom managed records and record operators.

Copy these XML files to C:\\Users\\\<username\>\\Documents\\Embarcadero\\Studio\\code_templates and they'll appear in your Templates window when you edit a Pascal/Delphi file, ready for you to insert them into your project.

Enjoy!
